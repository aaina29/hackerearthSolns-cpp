/*The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique.  For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, 
B would become C, and so on. Thus to cipher a given text we need an integer value, known as shift which indicates the number of position each letter of 
the text has been moved down.
The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,â€¦, Z = 25. 
Encryption of a letter by a shift n can be described mathematically as.
